Experimenting With ControlNet

ControlNet serves to provide additional control over the generation process of Stable Diffusion, aiming to preserve specific characteristics of the input image. This is achieved by allowing Stable Diffusion to incorporate supplementary input conditions that constrain the model during the generation process. These conditions can include an outline, the subject's pose, or any ControlNet that you train yourself.

The image above shows the result I obtained using a Line Segment Detector to generate the conditioning image.
